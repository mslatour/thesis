\subsection{Parameters}
\subsubsection{Population size}
The number of individuals in each generation. The larger this value is, the
more diversity can occur in each generation. The actual amount of diversity is
also determined by the diversity of the previous generation, the selection
mechanism and the mutation rate.

What the population size does directly influence is the number of crossover
operations.
