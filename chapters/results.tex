\section{In short}
\label{sec:results_short}
The main question that needed to be answered by this experiment is: does the
system learn to pick sequences with more learning impact over those with less
impact? Table~\ref{tab:pop_metrics} shows an overview of the important metric values
for each population. In the populations \emph{Rules low}, \emph{Intuition low},
\emph{Binary low} and \emph{Nim-sum low}, the system reduced and stabilized the
growth of the regret. In those populations, the system converged to the best
sequence encountered. The \emph{Rules high}, \emph{Binary high} and
\emph{Nim-sum high} populations did not receive enough participants to conclude
anything. Table~\ref{tab:exp_stats_students} shows the number of evaluations
received for each population. In population \emph{Intuition high}, the system
was not successful in stabilizing the regret. This is likely due to a bug,
which is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:results_intuition}. The
same has occured in population \emph{Binary high}.\\\\
\noindent
The answer to the question is, yes in some populations it did. It is not known
whether the sequences that appeared to be the best are actually the global
optimum. The estimated fitness values of some of the best sequences are quite
low, especially in the case of the \emph{Nim-sum low} population. It is not
unlikely that the approach got stuck in a local optimum in this case. However,
the estimated fitness of the best sequence in the \emph{Rules low} population
is much more convincing. The populations in which the system did not seem to
work had either too little data or were affected by a bug. However, it is of
course not certain that the system would've been successful in those
populations otherwise.

\section{Deeper analysis}
\label{sec:results_analysis}
\subsection{Lesson: Rules}
\label{sec:results_rules}
The \emph{Rules low} population completed 22 generations and received 
223 evaluations by students. At the end of the experiment
this population converged to the best sequence encountered. The
sequence contains Resource~3 and Resource~1, in that order, and will be
referred to as \emph{Sequence~[3,1]} for the rest of the chapter. In total 103
out of 178 students that got \emph{Sequence~[3,1]} answered all post-test
questions correctly. A graph of all evaluations of this sequence can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_eval_rules_low_372}.
The estimated fitness of \emph{Sequence~[3,1]} at the end of the experiment was
0.7634. \emph{Sequence~[3,1]} was created by a mutation on Resource~3 in the transition
from the fourth to the fifth generation that added Resource~1. At first,
Resource~1 dissapeared from the population after not being selected for the
second generation. Resource~3 had the highest fitness of the first four
generations \\\\
\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cumul_rules_low} shows that after 40 evaluations, in the fifth generation, \emph{TutOER}
switches to the evaluation of \emph{Sequence~[3,1]}. This is only deviated from at
two points. First, at the 81st evaluation, the \emph{TutOER} system tried out
Resource~1 once more. Second, from evaluation 141 till 144 the \emph{TutOER}
system evaluated the mirrored version of \emph{Sequence~[3,1]} that ended with
Resource~3. In both cases however, the \emph{TutOER} system returned to the
optimal sequence.\\\\
\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cover_rules_low} shows the \emph{Rules low} population
encountered a fifth of all sequences, namely eight out of 40. Although this was
enough to find \emph{Sequence~[3,1]}, the large majority of sequences was not
attempted. No sequences of three resources were attempted. These sequences
filled 60\% of the total number of possible sequences in this experiment. When
comparing to the possible sequences of two resources maximum, the \emph{TutOER}
system evaluated half.\\\\
\noindent
The \emph{Rules high} population encountered five out of 40 possible sequences.
However, in contrast to \emph{Rules low}, only 30 evaluations were collected.
As a result, the population completed just two generations. The best sequence at the
end of the experiment contained only Resource~1. The estimated fitness of this
sequence is 0.4388. The number of evaluations is however too low to put much
value on the estimate. Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cumul_rules_high} shows the
cumulative regret built-up in \emph{Rules high}. The best sequence at the end of the experiment is
already present in the first generation and remains present in each consecutive
generation. In the third generation, \emph{Sequence~[3,1]} enters the population
by means of immigration from the \emph{Rules low} population. The new sequence
is tried four times in a row and two times later on, but the measured fitness
was lower than the current best sequence.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Lesson: Intuition}
\label{sec:results_intuition}
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cumul_intuition_low} shows the cumulative regret of the
\emph{Intuition low} population. During the experiment 108 evaluations were
received from students. The best sequence at the end of the generation is
\emph{Sequence~[6]}. The sequence was already present in the first generation
and remained present throughout all eleven generations. The estimated fitness of
\emph{Sequence~[6]} is 0.4576. The range of observed fitness values for
\emph{Sequence~[6]} is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:exp_eval_intuition_low_14}.
\\\\
\noindent
In the second generation of the \emph{Intuition low} population, the
\emph{TutOER} system tried out the sequence of Resource~5 and Resource~6
several times in both orderings. Both however scored lower than the best
sequence in that generation. As a result, in the third generation almost all
individuals contained \emph{Sequence~[6]}. This is also visualized in
Table~\ref{tab:results_diversity} that shows the diversity of the
\emph{Intuition low} population dropped to 29\%, which means there are two
types of sequences in the generation. From the second generation onwards, the
\emph{TutOER} system sticks to presenting \emph{Sequence~6}. The only exception
is the 61st evaluation where \emph{Sequence~[6,8]}, coming from the
\emph{Intuition high} population, is tried once. At the end of the experiment
seven out of the 40 sequences were encountered, which is also shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cover_intuition_low}.\\\\
\noindent
The best sequence in the \emph{Intuition high}
population at the end of the experiment is \emph{Sequence~[6,8]}. The estimated
fitness value of this sequence is 0.5959. However, the \emph{TutOER} system did
not manage to hold on to this sequence. As a result, it was only evaluated ten
times. Figure~\ref{fig:exp_eval_intuition_high_373} displays the observed
fitness values. After the first generation, three consecutive generations were
dominated by \emph{Sequence~[6]}. All other sequences that were present in the
first generation had a negative estimated fitness. In the roulette wheel
selection these sequences have a zero chance of being selected. Furthermore,
the elite member slots were filled with the two occurences of
\emph{Sequence~[6]}. Table~\ref{tab:results_diversity} shows the drop in
diversity as a result. Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cover_intuition_high} shows that at
the end of the experiment six out of the 40 sequences were encountered.\\\\
\noindent
In the fifth generation a mutation on \emph{Sequence~[6]} resulted in
\emph{Sequence~[6,8]}. The \emph{TutOER} system lost the sequence in the
transition to the seventh generation. This is likely due to a bug in the
software related to sequences that migrated. As a consequence the aggregated
fitness value of those sequences was altered by both populations in which it
was present. This aggregated value was used by both the UCB algorithm and
roulette wheel selection. As a result, \emph{Sequence~[6]} appeared to have a
higher fitness than \emph{Sequence~[6,8]} when this was not the case. The bug
was discovered after the experiment was completed. The fitness estimates used
in this report are not affected by this bug.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Lesson: Binary}
\label{sec:results_binary}
The \emph{Binary low} population received 132 evaluations by students.
\emph{Sequence~[9]} turned out to be the best with an estimated fitness of
0.5251. Figure~\ref{fig:exp_eval_binary_low_17} shows the observed fitness
values for each of the 103 students that evaluated \emph{Sequence~[9]}.
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_age_binary_low} shows that these 103 evaluations make
\emph{Sequence~[9]} the most evaluated sequence in this population by far. Yet
eleven out of 40 possible sequences have been encountered, as can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cover_binary_low}. This is the highest coverage of the
eight populations.\\\\
\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cumul_binary_low} shows the cumulative regret in the
\emph{Binary low} population. The best sequence, \emph{Sequence~[9]}, is
already present in the first generation. From the 40th evaluation, the \emph{TutOER}
system sticks to \emph{Sequence~[9]}. In the seventh generation, a few
evaluations were assigned to \emph{Sequence~[9,11]}. However, with an estimated
fitness of 0.4676 this sequence did not outperform \emph{Sequence~[9]}.\\\\
\noindent
Contrary to its counterpart, population \emph{Binary high} has the lowest
coverage of all populations. Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cover_binary_high} shows that
only 4 out of 40 sequences have been encountered. That is the coverage
that every population starts with. No crossover operations were applied in the
transition to the second population. The order of the sampling of survivors
resulted in two pairs of equal chromosomes and one different chromosome at the
end. The parent selection selects pairs from this sampled list of survivors
from top to bottom to be potential parents. The first two pairs of
parents were identical and therefore unfit for crossover. The last survivor
could not be paired with anything. As a result, the second generation of the
\emph{Binary high} population was filled with survivors and not with their
offspring.\\\\
\noindent
The third generation contained only \emph{Sequence~[12]} apart from the two
elite members that carried \emph{Sequence~[9]}. When only the same sequence is
sampled, no crossover can be applied. The reasoning is similar to that in the
previous paragraph. Table~\ref{tab:results_diversity} shows the reduction in
diversity in three generations.\\\\
\noindent
After 27 evaluations, the best sequence in \emph{Binary high} is
\emph{Sequence~[10]} with an estimated fitness of 0.3265. However,
Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cumul_binary_high} shows the \emph{TutOER} system does
not hold on to the best sequence. The bug relating to immigrated chromosomes
that was discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results_intuition} is likely the cause
of that. \emph{Sequence~[9]} that immigrated from \emph{Binary low} appeared to
be the best performing sequence. Even though \emph{Sequence~[10]} was in fact
the only sequence with a non-negative fitness estimate. However, with so few
evaluations it is hard to say whether \emph{Sequence~[10]} was actually good.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Lesson: Nim-sum}
\label{sec:results_nimsum}
The \emph{Nim-sum low} population gathered 166 evaluations by students at the
end of the experiment. From the 15th evaluation onwards, the \emph{TutOER}
system mainly stuck to evaluating \emph{Sequence~[16]}. This is also reflected
in the cumulative regret curves shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cumul_nimsum_low}.
With an estimated fitness of 0.2557, \emph{Sequence~[16]} turned out to be the
best sequence of the population. Figure~\ref{fig:exp_age_nimsum_low} shows the
difference between the number of evaluations of each sequence. The difference
between the first and second most evaluated sequence is 150 evaluations. This
difference is the largest of all other populations, but \emph{Rules low} comes
close with a difference of 148 evaluations. Also similar to in \emph{Rules
low}, eight out of 40 possible sequences were encountered. However, the
diversity in each generation is rather low. From the fourth to the eighth
generation, only one sequence was present. Table~\ref{tab:results_diversity}
shows the diversity per generation.\\\\
\noindent
The least matured population is \emph{Nim-sum high} with only 22 evaluations.
Despite the limited number of evaluations, ten out of 40 sequences were
encountered (Figure~\ref{fig:exp_cover_nimsum_high}).
Table~\ref{tab:results_diversity} shows the high diversity that is the cause of
this. The best sequence is \emph{Sequence~[15,16]} with an estimated fitness of
1.0. However, this sequence has only been evaluated once. The variance in the
fitness of all other learning materials shows that one evaluation provides very
little information.
