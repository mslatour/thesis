%immigration may not be best implemented by taking the best one, but instead
%take the most disputed one (with most variation)

%Bootstrapping:
% Should this be mentioned, since it has not been used in the experiment?
%Some of the OER repositories allow for teachers to give ratings for educational
%material. These ratings could be used as an apriori probability that the
%material is good. However, only a part the collection of materials will be
%rated. Therefore, educational material that does not have a rating is assumed
%to be rated neutral (i.e. the middle of a five-point scale).
% Each rating is an average given the number of raters. This number of raters should have impact on the value of the rating.
% Weighted ratings could work even better if the ratings are normalized with an average value of zero, resulting in a symmetrical scale of positive and negative values.
